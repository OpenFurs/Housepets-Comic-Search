# About _Searchpets!_

**Searchpets!** is a passion project initially created by[@maxthecomputer1](https://twitter.com/maxthecomputer1)
and [@skepfuskyjs](https://twitter.com/skepfusky); where users can search and bookmark the entire _Housepets!_
comic catalog by Rick Griffin.

## History

On March 2022, Max had this idea to create a Housepets search engine to look through recognizable memes

## Technical garbage

Searchpets is written in:

- **Next.js**, a web framework built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org), one of the popular JavaScript
  frameworks for building websites. We've written this on [TypeScript](https://www.typescript-lang.org) version of Next.js.
  - We also use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.org) for building the UI.
- **Python**, for gathering and updating up-to-date comics via the official Housepets! comic website
  and sending it to a [Redis](https://redis.io) database.

If you find any of this interesting, the [source code](https://github.com/openfurs/searchpets) for
_Searchpets!_ is completely free and open-source on GitHub!
