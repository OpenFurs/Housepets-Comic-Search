## About

_Searchpets!_ is an open source project as a search engine for searching comic pages, characters, and chapter arcs from
[_Housepets!_](https://www.housepetscomic.com), a webcomic series created by [Rick Griffin](https://www.rickgriffinstudios.com);
and was created by two passionate web developers from Indonesia and the Philippines, maxthecomputerfox and Kuroji Fusky.

Searchpets! was created on March 25, 2022 and finished a working prototype a month later, released as v1.

We created the project was we wanted to find an easier way to find the source comic for memes that were made from
a comic, so we did! And as aspiring and passionate web developers, we wanted to make something that we find easy to
use and help people along the way with the source code included.

## Infrastructure

When we first worked with this project, we're already planning things out when we first met; I did all of the
initial design and Max did all the backend work and used Linode to store comic data.

Currently, we use Vercel and Cloudflare to host this website; Redis to store all the comic database through
Amazon Web Services from Redis Cloud.
