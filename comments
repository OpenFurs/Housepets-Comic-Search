// oh yeah i think we should change this function name too?
        // how bout get_chapter_entries?
        // oki
        // ah noicee
        // yeh, "chaper" instead of "chapter"
        // sorry, my keys are a bit laggy sometimes lol
        // lurn hao 2 spel lmao
        // oh kuro >:3
        // hehe - so where is grab_first_comic method gonna be?
        // i think it should be on top of this method 


explanation to implementaion

// M: it's for the seccond implementation i showed you lol
        // K: aaah, but wth is that variable name, what are you implying here
        // M: i'm trying to say that the variable contains the starter comic for each chapter
        // K: hmm, but the issue there is that the chapters are in descending order, aka 2019-2015 or something
        // M: wait, give me a sec my brain just broke lol
        // K: oof lol
        // M: what i'm basically trying to do is make a name for a dict that contains this:
        {
            "comic-title-1": "chapter name 1",
            "comic-title-10": "chapter name 2",
            "comic-title-16": "chapter name 3",
            ... and this went only for the next 136 chapters
        } <- this is what gonna be returned uwu

        // K: ohhhh, then we can convert them into url links I suppose huh?
        // M: well this function is only gonna be used for the generation of the db, so we don't need to
        // convert them to url lol, you can check the pseudo code i sent you on how i will be assigning
        // what comics is in which chapter uwu
        // K: hmmm, okie - I kinda get it now
        // (btw don't delete this, this will be on my engineering blog lol)
        // M: oh alr lol, it's ok if you are a bit confused since it's a bit complex but needed to fasten the
        // time used to generate the data for each comics lol
        // K: so if I understood correctly, this method is gonna get the chapter title only? that's it?
        // M: well it's gonna grab the starting comic of that chapter and create a dict like what i showed you before uwu
        // K: so it's a dict of chapter titles?
        // M: well it's a dict of the title of the comic that started a chapter and what chapter it started
        // K: oooooh, now I get it - it's like an entry point it seems
        // M: yeah lol, so when we check when we are iterating over each comics on gen.py we can check if the comic
        // we are currently adding to the database if it started a chapter, and if it does the current chapter variable
        // changes uwu, you can see it on our current gen.py script
        // K: I see, although I can understand it now - you need to give some space gawddayum lmfao
        // M: oh alr, sorry lol
        // K: yeah lol, and also format with ASF
        // M: alr uwu, sooo uhh what should we name this var then?
        // K: I have a better idea
        // M: oooh, this is better lol
        // K: yehhh this is more understandable than whatever you named it previously lmfao
        // M: fair fair lol, naming variables can be hard sometimes lol
        // K: it is, but you need some decent vocabulary to pull it off lol
        // M: oh yeah definitely XD, hopefully i manage to send out what i was attempting to do
        // so we don't have to rewrite everything lol
        // K: now I get it now, so if I understood everything so far, iter. all chapters, then pluck one comic from it?
        // is that how it works?
        // M: well it grabs the comic that started the chapter >w>, wait let me grab an example lol
        // like when the comic "When Boredom Strikes" started the Imaginate chapter
        // K: that's the issue there, the comics in those chapters are sorted in descending order, so "When Boredom Strikes"
        // on that list, not to mention there are paginated pages too to iterate yet again
        // M: well the lucky thing is you actually help we wrote code so we can just grab a link of the chapter,
        // go to the last page and grab the comic that started that chapter, then we add {"when boredom strike":"Imaginate"}
        // all from the imaginate chapter link uwu
        // K: I dun get it
        // M: yeah trying to explain this is a bit tricky, let's go to the funcs.py file so i can show you
        // what i was intending to do lol

from get_comic_metadata:
// decided to use bs4 element instead since it provides more data
        // just use `target` instead, too ambigious
        // oh alr
        // "tagert" - Max 2023
        // blame my laptop's keyboard lol
        // nah that's more on you because you have fat fingers
        // lmao, alr fair fair lol
